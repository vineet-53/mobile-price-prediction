# Mobile Price Predction Model

## Overview

In this project, I built a model to predict mobile prices using machine learning based on various features. I used **Beautiful Soup to scrape the data** from Flipkart, and after cleaning and preprocessing the data, I performed an analysis of feature correlations.

I tested multiple algorithms, including **Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The SVM model stood out with the best performance, achieving a high **accuracy of 97.5%**. After scraping and testing the data, the overall model **accuracy was 96%**.

## Tech Stack

- Modeling:
  following machine learning algorithms applied:
  - [x] Decision Tree
  - [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - [x] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Evaluation:

- Used accuracy and confusion matrices to evaluate the model performance.

## Results

- SVM achieved the best results, with an accuracy of **97.5%**.

## Future Work
